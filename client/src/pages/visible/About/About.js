            Hallett Sargent is a New England author whose focus is toward
            stories that encompass a duality of local and global significance.
            She writes in the hope of providing a comfortable place for
            introspective thought that translates beyond the narrative and into
            actions on a broader field. Her first book,
            <span className="font-italic"> Our Bathroom Mirror</span>, takes
            cues from her environmental and educational work to build complexity
            in what may at first appear to be a simple world. Sargent thrives on
            stories that provoke logical speculation and fervent emotion in
            equal turn. A genuine appreciation for narratives of unique
            characters is shared with those curious readers who pick up her
            works, which uncover a subtle yet deep experience.
