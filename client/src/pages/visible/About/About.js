              Hallett Sargent is a New England author whose focus is toward
              stories that encompass a duality of local and global significance.
              She writes in the hope of providing a comfortable place for
              introspective thought that translates beyond the narrative and
              into actions on a broader field. Her first book,
              <span className="font-italic"> Our Bathroom Mirror</span>, takes
              cues from her environmental and educational work to build
              complexity in what may at first appear to be a simple world.
              Sargent thrives on stories that provoke logical speculation and
              fervent emotion in equal turn. A genuine appreciation for
              narratives of unique characters is shared with those curious
              readers who pick up her works, which uncover a subtle yet deep
              experience.
